\arguments{
\item{income}{vector of agent income (1 = <50k ; 2 = 50-100k per year ; 3 = >100k per year)}

\item{race}{vector of agent races}

\item{essential}{binary of whether agent is an essential worker}

\item{t_symptoms}{vector of time experiencing symptoms}

\item{t_since_contact}{vector of time left that person with known contact will consider contact a factor in testing decision}

\item{res_inf}{Number of identified infectious individuals in residence}

\item{res_type}{vector of residence types, "H", "N", "P"}

\item{tests_avail}{number of tests available - creates multiplier to serve as proxy for how good identification of infected individuals is}

\item{symp_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents with symptoms. Acts on a per-day with symptoms basis, so 2 days with symptoms * `symp_mult=10` would lead to 20x increase in test prob}

\item{race_mult}{vector with same length as number of race groups with change in baseline probability of being tested}

\item{cont_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents with suspeceted contact}

\item{res_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents with known infection in their residence}

\item{nosymp_state_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents who are infected but not shopwing symptoms (Ia or Ip)}

\item{symp_state_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents who are infected andshowing symptoms (Im or Imh)}

\item{hosp_mult}{multiplier for test probability for agents who are infected and hospitalized}
}
\value{
vector of length n_agents with generated test probabilities
