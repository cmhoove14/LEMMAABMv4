### Calibration runs summary  
Gave up on LHS approaches for the time being to manually tweak parameters based on what looked lacking in the fit, so documenting edits that were made at each iteration here:

1-3) Tweaking beta and sip_red parameters to get general fit to hospitalizations right. Still struggling to get subsequent waves well fit  
4) Edited transmission functionality so essential workers can be infected both at work and in community, reduced beta  
5) Further reduced beta  
6) Increased SiP to 1 so no effect  
7) Decreased probability of symptoms to match https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0962-9/figures/8 sinc mortality rates were too high
