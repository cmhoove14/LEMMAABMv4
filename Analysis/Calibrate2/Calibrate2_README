First round calibration using an latinhypercube with 27 parameters and broad uniform distributions resulted in no parameter sets that were particularly great at fitting. Closer inspection showed that range of beta tested was broader than necessary and PRCC global sensitivity analysis showed many model parameters did not have much influence on model outcomes. Given this, a more condensed latin hypercube was constructed
